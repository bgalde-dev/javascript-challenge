## The Truth is Out There
This project is to show dynamic filtering of loaded data. Taking given data of
UFO sightings and creating filters for many of the fields.

## Files
### Level 1
Level 1 is a basic filter of just finding and filtering based on a single date.

* [index.html](./ufo-level-1/index.html) the page with the basic filter.
* [app.js](./static/js/ufo-level-1/app.js) has the Javascript logic to build and run the page.
* [data.js](./static/js/ufo-level-1/data.js) has the data for the UFO sittings.
### Level 2
Level 2 is a more advanced filter. This will allow you to search a range of dates, city, state,
country, and shape. Other than the dates all the other fields are drop downs to select based on the data.
This will update on a reload if needed. The dates they must be in the form of mm/dd/yyyy. Currently no serious 
validation is done on the form. Additionally there is a reset button to clear the form.


* [index.html](./ufo-level-2/index.html) the page with the advanced filter.
* [app.js](./static/js/ufo-level-2/app.js) has the Javascript logic to build and run the page.
* [data.js](./static/js/ufo-level-2/data.js) has the data for the UFO sittings.
